# NumberRecognizer

This app utilizes Tensorflow.js to take in a drawing from an html canvas and run the image through a convolutional neural network trained on thhe MNIST Digit Recognition Dataset. For now, the website must be hosted on the local machine (use the command python3 -m http.server) and then accessed via the localhost. 

## Future Work

1. Host site on sidijju.github.io
2. Improve number recognition model
3. Improve website look via css
4. Add more features (drawing recognizer, etc.)
